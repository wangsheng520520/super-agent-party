## Introduction

### 🚀 **An AI desktop companion with endless possibilities!**  

- ✅ Omnichannel One-Click Deployment: Supports rapid deployment of agent configurations to multiple terminals, already compatible with scenarios such as classic chat interfaces, desktop companion, QQ, Feishu, Discord, Telegram chatbots, Bilibili, YouTube, Twitch live-streaming bots, and more—ready to use out of the box.  

- ✅ Ecosystem Tool Interconnectivity: Freely integrates third-party agents and workflows as toolchains (already adapted for systems like Home Assistant, Claude Code, Qwen Code, Dify, ComfyUI, MCP, A2A, etc.), enabling cross-platform capability aggregation through the Agent-Party architecture.  

- ✅ Rich Extension Ecosystem: Supports custom extension development, with community sharing via the official [Extension Marketplace](https://super-agent-party.github.io/plugins.html) to meet personalized needs.  

- ✅ Standardized interface openness: Provides OpenAI API-compatible interfaces and MCP protocol support, facilitating developers' direct integration with external systems for rapid agent capability transfer and secondary development. The VRM desktop pet supports the VMC protocol, enabling cross-application action synchronization. The VRM desktop pet interface also supports the webXR protocol, allowing immersive experiences on XR-compatible devices.

- ✅ Seamless capability enhancement: It is possible to achieve an enterprise-level upgrade of the LLM API without code modification, seamlessly integrating knowledge bases, real-time networking, permanent memory, compatible SillyTavern Character Card, code execution, multimodal capabilities (vision/drawing/audition/speech), Automation capabilities (controlling smart homes, controlling browsers), deep thinking control and research, and other modular functions into the existing model interface, creating a pluggable LLM enhancement platform.

- ✅ Compatible and adaptable across all platforms: It covers the native running environments of Windows/macOS/Linux, supports Docker containerized deployment and web-based cloud services, and meets the needs of multi-scene technology stacks.

👉 [SAP-lite-Windows-exe](https://github.com/heshengtao/desktop-for-sap/releases/download/v0.1.1/super-agent-party-lite-Setup-0.1.1.exe)

👉 [SAP-lite-MacOS-dmg](https://github.com/heshengtao/desktop-for-sap/releases/download/v0.1.1/super-agent-party-lite-0.1.1-Mac.dmg)

### Source Code Deployment

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/heshengtao/super-agent-party.git
  cd super-agent-party
  uv sync
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

## Extension

Added a brand-new extension system. You can check available plugins at [plugins list](https://super-agent-party.github.io/plugins.html), or directly view and install them in the party under 【Developer】->【Extensions】. You can also add your own developed extensions to the official plugin list at [super-agent-party.github.io](https://github.com/super-agent-party/super-agent-party.github.io)! 

## Hardware requirements

- CPU: 2 cores or more
- Memory: 2GB or more

**Because all models are optional, you can access the local deployment engine, or you can all use the Cloud as a Service provider interface, so there are few hardware requirements. Test the docker version on the 2-core 2G Cloud as a Service server and it will work fine**

## Usage

- Desktop: Click the desktop icon to use immediately.

- Web or docker: Access http://localhost:3456/ after startup.

- API call: Developer-friendly, perfectly compatible with OpenAI format, can output in real-time, and does not affect the original API's response speed. No need to modify the calling code:

  ```python
  from openai import OpenAI
  client = OpenAI(
    api_key="super-secret-key",
    base_url="http://localhost:3456/v1"
  )
  response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="super-model",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is Super Agent Party?"}
    ]
  )
  print(response.choices[0].message.content)
  ```

- MCP call: After starting, you can invoke the local MCP service by writing the following content in the configuration file:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "super-agent-party": {
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3456/mcp",
      }
    }
  }
  ```

The project contributors do not assume any responsibility for the completeness, accuracy, reliability, or applicability of the project. Any behavior that relies on the project content shall be at the user's own risk. In any case, the project contributors shall not be liable for any indirect, special, or incidental losses or damages arising from the use of the project content.

## Special Note  
1. Certain features of this open-source project (such as Edge TTS voice synthesis, Bilibili WebSocket danmaku monitoring, etc.) rely on public interfaces or experimental functionalities provided by third-party services. These features may become unavailable at any time due to changes in third-party policies. The developer assumes no responsibility for their stability, legality, or continuity.By using this project, users are deemed to have understood and agreed to assume the associated risks. The developer does not recommend or encourage the use of these functions for commercial or large-scale deployment scenarios.

2. The QQ bot utilizes the official QQ bot interface. Please comply with the [AIGC QQ Bot Usage Guidelines](https://q.qq.com/#/news/detail?id=1376238e8e2fbbc036676bb09d2f37da).

3. The browser control functionality provided in this project is an accessibility-assisted browsing interface based on large language models (LLMs). It is designed to help visually impaired individuals, the elderly, or those with mobility challenges operate browsers more conveniently through natural language commands, using AI visual recognition technology. It is not intended for automated crawling or hacking purposes. The project adopts a technical architecture of "LLM visual reasoning → single-step operation." The accessibility-assisted browsing interface has the following characteristics:  
   a. Non-high-frequency concurrency: Due to reliance on LLM reasoning speed (3–5 seconds per step) and built-in randomized human-like delay algorithms, the tool's operation frequency is strictly lower than the maximum manual speed of a typical human user.  
   b. No server pressure: This tool does not support multi-threaded concurrency, batch data scraping, or DDoS attacks. From the server's perspective, its behavior is indistinguishable from that of a regular human user and will not impose additional load on the target website's server.

4. Do not use this project on banking, payment gateway, or highly confidential information pages. The developer is not responsible for privacy breaches caused by improper user operations. Prohibited behaviors include large-scale data scraping, bypassing security mechanisms, network interference, and violations of laws and regulations.

5.

These identifiers are displayed solely for the convenience of users to recognize the models or services used and do not imply any official affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement by these rights holders. If the relevant trademark, interface, or brand owner believes that the use of this project is inappropriate or does not wish their brand identifiers/interfaces to be displayed or accessed through this software, please contact the repository administrator via GitHub Issues or hst97@qq.com. We will promptly (usually within 48 hours) remove, delete, or modify the content as requested upon receiving notice.

6. This project is an independently developed open-source tool. When users utilize this software to access third-party API services, they are responsible for complying with the relevant service providers' Terms of Service.

7. Any content generated by this software through third-party large models is the responsibility of the model providers and user actions in terms of accuracy, completeness, and compliance. The author of this software assumes no legal liability for such content.

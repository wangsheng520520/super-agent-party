## Introduction

### 🚀 **A 3D AI desktop companion with endless possibilities!**  

- ✅ Seamless capability enhancement: It is possible to achieve an enterprise-level upgrade of the LLM API without code modification, seamlessly integrating knowledge bases, real-time networking, permanent memory, compatible SillyTavern Character Card, code execution, multimodal capabilities (vision/drawing/audition/speech), Automation capabilities (controlling smart homes, controlling browsers), deep thinking control and research, and other modular functions into the existing model interface, creating a pluggable LLM enhancement platform.

- ✅ One-click deployment across all channels: It supports the rapid deployment of intelligent agents to multiple types of terminals, and is compatible with scenarios such as classic chat interfaces, QQ official robots, Bilibili live interaction, and VRM virtual desktop pets, ready to use out of the box.

- ✅ Ecological tool interconnection: It can freely access third-party intelligent entities and workflows as a tool chain (already adapted to systems such as Home Assistant/Claude code/Dify/ComfyUI/MCP/A2A), and achieve cross-platform capability aggregation through the agent-party architecture.

- ✅ Standardized interface opening: Provide OpenAI API-compatible interfaces and MCP protocol support, making it easy for developers to directly connect to external systems and achieve rapid transfer and secondary development of the agent's capabilities.

- ✅ Compatible and adaptable across all platforms: It covers the native running environments of Windows/macOS/Linux, supports Docker containerized deployment and web-based cloud services, and meets the needs of multi-scene technology stacks.

## Quick Start

  ```

### Linux Desktop Installation

We provide two mainstream Linux installation package formats for your convenience in different scenarios.

#### 1. Install using `.AppImage`

`.AppImage` is a Linux application format that does not require installation and can be used immediately. Suitable for most Linux distributions.

  👉 [Click to download](https://github.com/heshengtao/super-agent-party/releases/download/v0.3.1/Super-Agent-Party-0.3.1-Linux.AppImage)

#### 2. Install using `.deb` package (Suitable for Ubuntu/Debian systems)

  👉 [Click to download](https://github.com/heshengtao/super-agent-party/releases/download/v0.3.1/Super-Agent-Party-0.3.1-Linux.deb)

### Docker Deployment (This version of the table pet can only be viewed through the browser.)

- Two commands to install this project:
  ```shell
  docker pull ailm32442/super-agent-party:latest
  docker run -d -p 3456:3456 -v ./super-agent-data:/app/data ailm32442/super-agent-party:latest
  ```

- ⭐Note! `./super-agent-data` can be replaced with any local folder, after Docker starts, all data will be cached in this local folder and will not be uploaded anywhere.

- Plug and play: access http://localhost:3456/

### Source Code Deployment

- windows ：
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/heshengtao/super-agent-party.git
  cd super-agent-party
  install.bat
  npm run dev
  ```

- linux or mac ：
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/heshengtao/super-agent-party.git
  cd super-agent-party
  chmod +x install.sh
  ./install.sh
  npm run dev
  ```

## Software Screenshots

### Multi-Service Provider Support: Supports both locally deployed engines (e.g., Ollama, Dify) and cloud service provider APIs.
![image](doc/image/model1.jpeg)

### Extensive Tool Integration: Built-in various tools (e.g., knowledge base, web search, smart home control, browser automation), supporting asynchronous invocation without blocking agent responses.

## Hardware requirements

- CPU: 2 cores or more
- Memory: 2GB or more

**Because all models are optional, you can access the local deployment engine, or you can all use the Cloud as a Service provider interface, so there are few hardware requirements. Test the docker version on the 2-core 2G Cloud as a Service server and it will work fine**

## Usage

- Desktop: Click the desktop icon to use immediately.

- Web or docker: Access http://localhost:3456/ after startup.

- API call: Developer-friendly, perfectly compatible with OpenAI format, can output in real-time, and does not affect the original API's response speed. No need to modify the calling code:

  ```python
  from openai import OpenAI
  client = OpenAI(
    api_key="super-secret-key",
    base_url="http://localhost:3456/v1"
  )
  response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="super-model",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is Super Agent Party?"}
    ]
  )
  print(response.choices[0].message.content)
  ```

- MCP call: After starting, you can invoke the local MCP service by writing the following content in the configuration file:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "super-agent-party": {
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3456/mcp",
      }
    }
  }
  ```
